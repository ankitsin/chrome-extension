# chrome-extension
This is chrome extesnion which works on EvoMovies.com for the rating of the movies. The rating are taken from IMDB via omdb api.
The extesnion currently works only on one site. The extension works automatically as soon as site is opened, no need of clicking extension button. Currently only three files are needed( manifest.json, myscript.js, jquery.js) for the working of the extnsion. script.py is in working phase.
